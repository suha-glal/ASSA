# ASSA
This is my master thesis project

The system is built to acquire Arabic text from Twitter and extract usersâ€™ opinions towards different topics and products. To develop our Arabic Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (ASSA) system, two stages were performed. In the first stage, we built a computational model that firstly identifies subjective text and then performs polarity classification. In the second stage, we employed the developed model to classify new tweet instances. The first stage consisted of six phases: Data Acquisition, followed by Tweet- Filtering phase, then Data Annotation phase, Data-Preprocessing phase, Feature Identification phase, and finally Classification Phase. The second stage consisted of four phases: Data Acquisition, Data- Preprocessing phase, Feature Identification phase, and finally Classification Phase. The project was developed using Java.
